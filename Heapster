    - Elasticsearch
      This sink supports monitoring metrics and events. To use the Elasticsearch sink add the following flag:

          --sink=elasticsearch:<ES_SERVER_URL>[?<OPTIONS>]
      Normally an Elasticsearch cluster has multiple nodes or a proxy, so these need to be configured for the Elasticsearch sink. To do this, you can set ES_SERVER_URL to a dummy value, and use the ?nodes= query value for each additional node in the cluster. For example:

        --sink=elasticsearch:?nodes=http://foo.com:9200&nodes=http://bar.com:9200
      (*) Notice that using the ?nodes notation will override the ES_SERVER_URL

      If you run your ElasticSearch cluster behind a loadbalancer (or otherwise do not want to specify multiple nodes) then you can do the following:

        --sink=elasticsearch:http://elasticsearch.example.com:9200?sniff=false
      Besides this, the following options can be set in query string:

      (*) Note that the keys are case sensitive

      index - the index for metrics and events. The default is heapster
      esUserName - the username if authentication is enabled
      esUserSecret - the password if authentication is enabled
      maxRetries - the number of retries that the Elastic client will perform for a single request after before giving up and return an error. It is 0 by default, so retry is disabled by default.
      healthCheck - specifies if healthchecks are enabled by default. It is enabled by default. To disable, provide a negative boolean value like 0 or false.
      sniff - specifies if the sniffer is enabled by default. It is enabled by default. To disable, provide a negative boolean value like 0 or false.
      startupHealthcheckTimeout - the time in seconds the healthcheck waits for a response from Elasticsearch on startup, i.e. when creating a client. The default value is 1.
      ver - ElasticSearch cluster version, can be either 2 or 5. The default is 5
      bulkWorkers - number of workers for bulk processing. Default value is 5.
      cluster_name - cluster name for different Kubernetes clusters. Default value is default.
      pipeline - (optional; >ES5) Ingest Pipeline to process the documents. The default is disabled(empty value)
